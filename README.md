# NL-to-OpenAPI
This repository contains the NL-to-OpenAPI dataset for structured data retrieval evaluation. It also contains the prompts used to generate the lexical queries, semantic queries and summary portions of the data. 

# Data:

- The **api_url** is the URL you can use to find the OpenAPI specification online.
- The **api_spec** is the raw OpenAPI specification.
- The **question_struct** is the semantic questions related to the OpenAPI specification.
- The **lexical_struct** is the lexical questions related to the OpenAPI specification.
- The **summary** is the LLM generated summary.
- The **description_summary** is the summary generated by concatenating the descriptions within the OpenAPI specification
- The **struc_api_spec** is the OpenAPI specification with the structural components removed but the spacing preserved.
- The **flattened_api_spec** is the OpenAPI specification with the structural components and the spacing removed.

# How to use:

Use the NL queries to retrieve the OpenAPI specifications either through the raw spec or the different representations of the spec (e.g. LLM summary).
